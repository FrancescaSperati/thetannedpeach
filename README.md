Pushed the newer version of the website. 

<b>Need to fix:</b><br />
-> The nav bar streaches to contain the results of the search <br />
-> Currently the search doesn't point to the product details of that specific item after click <br />

<b>WIP</b>
-> Alternative page just for registration since we need all the information from the customer ?<br />
-> Search bar display thumbnail of product, name and price.<br /> 
Enconutered problem on inner join with 3 tables since for that we need category, image and item tables.

Unfortunately I failed in implementing the menu on the parallax. There is something that I missed. Unfortunately I was very tired yesterday so I took a day off from all school related stuff. 

On the bright side, I bumped into these free resources that we could use as starting point if we see it fit. Or we can simply use it to test possible changes quickly without having to implement a UI first. 

It has quite a few UI elements, but since it's the free version it's limited. It has parallax, login and other interesting elements. Let me know what you think.

The itemDB file doesn't have an extention. If you save it as .sql you can import it after you create a DB.
So in steps:
- Create a DB in MAMP or XAMP
- In the import section you can import the SQL file and after executing, you will have the "item" table.
